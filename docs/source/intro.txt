Introduction

**OpenPTV** is the abbreviation for the Open Source Particle Tracking Velocimetry consortium. The core of  this software is the 3D-PTV software originally developed at ETH Zurich. The consortium of the academic institutions  is working on improving the core algorithms, developing a stand-alone library with a simpler and clear API. We also develop the new user interface in Python, that started at the Tel Aviv University. Read more about the consortium on our website http://www.openptv.net 

In the future we would like to allow everyone to add their algorithms to the OpenPTV 
library, named ``liboptv`` and develop several interfaces, combining it with the pre- 
and post-processing routines using Python/NumPy/SciPy/PIL/Matplotlib/Mayavi/etc. See the existing repositories on http://github.com/OpenPTV
